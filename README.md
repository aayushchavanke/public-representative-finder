## 💻 Local Setup & Running Tips  

### **Viewing the Map Locally**  

1. **Use VS Code Live Server**:  
   - Install the **Live Server extension** in **VS Code**.  
   - Right-click `index.html` > **Open with Live Server**.  
   - This allows you to bypass **CORS** restrictions and view the map smoothly.

2. **Local Server Option**:  
   - **Python HTTP server**:  
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` to view your project.

3. **Geolocation (Optional)**:  
   - Ensure **Geolocation API** works properly by running locally with **Live Server** or a local server.  
   - Use the browser's geolocation to pinpoint your area automatically.
